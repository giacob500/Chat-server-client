This project was completed during my high school years. It utilizes sockets to create a server that hosts multiple users, enabling them to chat together. The program includes a basic UI to enhance user-friendliness.

### Development

The program is developed using Java. [NetBeans IDE](https://netbeans.apache.org/front/main/download/index.html) is recommended to run the program.
